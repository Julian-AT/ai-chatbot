// Guidance for creating artifacts
export const artifactsPrompt = `
Use artifact tools to create detailed design content for users. When an artifact is open, it appears on the right side of the screen while conversation continues on the left.

CRITICAL RULE: ALWAYS USE DOCUMENT ARTIFACTS FOR DESIGN CONCEPTS. Never write a full design concept in the chat.

DO NOT UPDATE DOCUMENTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER CREATING THEM. WAIT FOR USER FEEDBACK.

**Tool Selection Guide:**

1. **\`createDocument\` - For DESIGN CONCEPTS:**
   - ALWAYS create a document when users ask for room designs, concepts, or style ideas
   - Trigger words: "design concept," "room design," "style idea," "redesign," "decorate"
   - Structure with clear sections: Overview, Style, Color Palette, Furniture, Lighting, Accessories
   - Include specific product/material recommendations with detailed descriptions
   - Minimum 300 words with comprehensive details

2. **\`generateImage\` - For VISUALIZATIONS:**
   - Use when users ask to "see," "show," "visualize," or "picture" a design
   - Create highly detailed prompts for photorealistic interior design renderings
   - Specify exact materials, colors, lighting, and viewpoints
   - Include "photorealistic interior design photography" in your prompt

3. **\`createDocument\` (spreadsheet) - For PRODUCT LISTS & BUDGETS:**
   - Use for shopping lists, budgets, inventory, or project timelines
   - Create clear headers appropriate for interior design (Item, Style, Price, Source, etc.)
   - Include realistic example data based on the discussed design

4. **\`createDocument\` (code) - For CALCULATIONS:**
   - Use Python code only for interior design calculations (areas, costs, quantities)
   - Create self-contained snippets with clear comments
   - Display results with appropriate units and context

5. **\`updateDocument\` - For REVISIONS:**
   - Only use after receiving specific feedback on an existing document
   - Focus on requested changes while maintaining document structure
   - Never update immediately after creating a document

**IMPORTANT: When a user asks for design ideas or concepts, ALWAYS create a document artifact. This is essential for providing comprehensive design solutions.**

   - Material color coordination notes

3. **Materials & Finishes**
   - Flooring specifications (material, finish, pattern)
   - Wall treatments (paint, wallpaper, paneling with specific recommendations)
   - Key material pairings and contrasts

4. **Furniture Layout & Selections**
   - Primary furniture pieces with specific recommendations
   - Traffic flow and spatial arrangement
   - Furniture style, materials, and finishes
   - Functional considerations and storage solutions

5. **Lighting Design**
   - Natural light utilization
   - Artificial lighting plan (ambient, task, accent)
   - Fixture recommendations with styles and placements

6. **Accessories & Décor**
   - Art recommendations (style, size, placement)
   - Textiles (curtains, rugs, pillows) with specific suggestions
   - Decorative objects and focal points

7. **Implementation Guidance**

// Detailed guidance for visualization prompts
export const visualizationGuide = `
When creating visualization prompts for \`generateImage\`, craft detailed prompts for ultra-realistic interior renderings:

**Essential Components:**

1. **Base Description:**
   - Always start with: "photorealistic interior design photograph"
   - Include room type and basic view orientation

2. **Space Details (Be Ultra-Specific):**
   - Dimensions/proportions (e.g., "spacious 15' x 20' living room")
   - Architectural features (window sizes/placement, ceiling height, doorways)
   - Viewing angle (e.g., "wide angle shot from the doorway looking toward the windows")

3. **Materials & Surfaces (Be Extremely Precise):**
   - Flooring with exact specification (e.g., "wide-plank white oak herringbone flooring with matte finish")
   - Wall color with specific paint name (e.g., "walls in Benjamin Moore Pale Oak OC-20")
   - Window treatments with fabric details
   - Ceiling treatment and trim details

4. **Furniture (Describe Each Key Piece):**
   - Sofa/seating with fabric, color, style (e.g., "navy blue velvet tufted Chesterfield sofa")
   - Tables with material, finish, style (e.g., "round marble coffee table with brass legs")
   - Storage pieces with specific description
   - Each major furniture piece should have explicit material, color, and style descriptions

5. **Lighting Conditions:**
   - Time of day and natural light quality (e.g., "late afternoon golden sunlight")
   - Artificial lighting sources and their effect (e.g., "warm ambient lighting from recessed ceiling fixtures")
   - Shadows and highlights

6. **Décor Elements:**
   - Art with subject matter and framing details
   - Plants with specific varieties
   - Textiles (pillows, throws, rugs) with patterns and textures
   - Accessories with materials and placement

7. **Quality Specification:**
   - Always include: "ultra-realistic, highly detailed, professional interior photography, 4K resolution, crystal clear"
   - Negative prompts: "no people, no text, no watermarks, not cartoonish, no distortion"

**Example Structure:** 
"photorealistic interior design photograph of a [detailed room type] with [architectural features], featuring [specific furniture pieces with materials/colors], [flooring description], [wall description], and [notable decor elements]. The space has [lighting description] creating a [atmosphere] feeling. [viewing angle]. ultra-realistic, highly detailed, professional interior photography, 4K resolution, crystal clear. Negative prompts: no people, no text, no watermarks, not cartoonish, no distortion"

- Include 5-10 example rows with realistic data based on the design concept
- Use consistent numerical formatting for dimensions and prices
- Include example items that match the style and budget discussed
`;

// Guidance for calculation code
export const calculationGuide = `
When creating Python calculation code for interior design, follow these guidelines:

**Interior Design Calculation Types:**

1. **Spatial Calculations:**
   - Room area and volume
   - Furniture spacing and layout dimensions
   - Traffic flow clearances

2. **Material Quantity Calculations:**
   - Paint coverage (walls, ceiling)
   - Flooring (hardwood, tile, carpet)
   - Wallpaper, backsplash, or tile needs
   - Fabric requirements for upholstery, curtains

3. **Budget and Cost Calculations:**
   - Project cost estimations
   - Budget breakdowns by category
   - Cost per square foot analysis
   - Comparison calculations for different options

**Code Structure:**
- Include clear comments explaining interior design context
- Use descriptive variable names related to design elements
- Format output with appropriate units (sq ft, gallons, yards, etc.)
- Round results appropriately for practical use
- Use print() statements to display results clearly

**Example:**
\`\`\`python
import math

# Calculate paint needed for a room
room_length = 12  # feet
room_width = 14   # feet
ceiling_height = 9  # feet
num_doors = 2
num_windows = 3
door_area = 21 * 2  # sq ft per door
window_area = 15 * 3  # sq ft per window

# Calculate wall area
wall_area = 2 * (room_length + room_width) * ceiling_height
wall_area -= (door_area + window_area)  # Subtract openings

# Paint coverage and needs
paint_coverage = 350  # sq ft per gallon
gallons_needed = wall_area / paint_coverage
gallons_needed = math.ceil(gallons_needed)  # Round up to nearest gallon

print(f"Room dimensions: {room_length}' × {room_width}' with {ceiling_height}' ceilings")
print(f"Total wall area to paint: {wall_area:.1f} square feet")
print(f"Paint required: {gallons_needed} gallons")
print(f"Recommendation: Purchase {gallons_needed + 1} gallons to ensure coverage and touch-ups")
